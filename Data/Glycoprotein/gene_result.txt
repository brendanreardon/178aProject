GeneRIFs: Gene References Into Functions

1. The glycoprotein's internal fusion loop is critical for viral entry and fusion.
2. GP play multiple functions including virus attachment and entry, cell rounding
and cytotoxicity and down-regulation of host surface proteins.[review]
3. findings demonstrate that a GP mutant, GP-F88A, defective for entry into a
variety of human cell types, including antigen-presenting cells (APCs) can
mediate viral entry into mouse CD11b( ) APCs; studies suggest an important role
for NPC1 in the differential entry of GP-F88A into mouse versus human APCs
4. Neither EBV GP nor HIV-1 Vpu had any effect on tetherin's distribution within
lipid raft domains.
5. Purified human NPC1 binds only to a cleaved form of Ebola virus spike
glycoprotein that is generated within cells during entry, and only viruses
containing cleaved glycoprotein can utilize a receptor retargeted to the cell
surface.
6. Ebola virus GP forms a tandem beta-hairpin structure that binds deeply into a
cleft in the antibody-combining site.
7. Cathepsins B and L activate Ebola but not Marburg virus glycoproteins for
efficient entry into cell lines and macrophages independent of TMPRSS2
expression.
8. Cathepsin L cleavage potentiates the Ebola virus GP to undergo a fusion-relevant 
conformational change.
9. R64 and K95 of GP1 are involved in receptor binding.
10. liposome fusion data and NMR structures for a complete (54-residue)
disulfide-bonded internal fusion loop (Ebov FL) in a membrane mimetic
11. Axl enhances entry of Zaire ebolavirus without direct interactions with the viral
glycoprotein.
12. While ssGP appears to share similar structural properties with sGP, it does not
appear to have the same anti-inflammatory function on endothelial cells as sGP.
13. These findings suggest that Ebola virus GP uses a novel mechanism to circumvent
tetherin restriction.
14. CatB cleavage is required to facilitate the triggering of viral membrane fusion
by destabilizing the prefusion conformation of EBOV GP
15. The authors show that the mucin domain from the highly pathogenic Zaire subtype
of Ebola virus is sufficient to cause characteristic cytopathology when expressed
in the context of a foreign glycoprotein.
16. the crystal structure of EBOV GP in its trimeric, pre-fusion conformation
(GP1+GP2) bound to a neutralizing antibody, KZ52, derived from a human survivor
of the 1995 Kikwit outbreak
17. Ebola virus GP cytotoxicity is regulated by dynamin-dependent cellular protein
trafficking
18. The transmembrane region of GP2 modifies the permeability of the plasma membrane.
